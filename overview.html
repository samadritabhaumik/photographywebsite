    <h1 id="hello">HELLO EVERYONE,</h1>
    <P id="sam">This side Samadrita.<br> This website is created by me for showcasting some of my clicks.
        Besides being an engineering student ,I am also passionate about photography and this website contains some of my captures.
        I love capturing every moment around me.As a student its not possible to afford to buy a DSLR for this purpose so I fulfill my passion using my phone camera.
        I have combined my knowledge with my passion and created this site.I would be grateful if you kindly spare some time here.
    </P>
    <p id="th">THANK YOU!</p>
